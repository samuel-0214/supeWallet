# supeWallet

"supeWallet" makes managing digital assets simple and intuitive. With a few easy commands, you can execute CrossChain transactions to send or transfer assets between wallets.
This project is a wallet that provides users with a seamless interface to perform various blockchain operations via simple natural language prompts. The platform integrates multiple blockchain protocols and technologies to enable the following functionalities:

- **Send Cryptocurrency Transactions**: Execute transactions (e.g., sending ETH) by providing prompts.
- **Encrypt and Transfer Files Securely**: Use the Lit Protocol to encrypt files and securely send them to a authorized receiver.
- **Mint and Transfer NFTs Cross-Chain**: Utilize the CCIP protocol for cross-chain NFT minting and transfer.
- **Real-World Asset Tokenization on Hedera**: Tokenize real-world assets like documents using the Hedera network.

## Features

1. **Send Cryptocurrency Transactions**: 
   - Users can execute cryptocurrency transactions by providing natural language prompts. For example, "Send 0.5 ETH to xyz wallet".
   - Supports Ethereum and other EVM-compatible networks.

2. **Encrypt and Send Files Securely**: 
   - Leverages the **Lit Protocol** for decentralized encryption of files.
   - Users can encrypt files and securely transfer them to another user.

3. **Cross-Chain NFT Minting and Transfer**:
   - Utilizes **Chainlink CCIP** (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) for minting NFTs and transferring them across different blockchains.
   - Supports cross-chain NFT transfers with a single prompt.

4. **Real-World Asset Tokenization on Hedera**:
   - Integrates the **Hedera Hashgraph** network to tokenize real-world assets like documents.
   - Stores metadata on IPFS and mints NFTs on Hedera.
